            Tourism contributes significantly to global gross domestic product, and is forecast to grow at an annual 4%, thus outpacing many other economic sectors.
            However, global carbon emissions related to tourism are currently not well quantified. We quantify tourism-related global carbon flows between 160
            countries, and their carbon footprints under origin and destination accounting perspectives.<br><br>
            We find that, between 2009 and 2013, tourism's global carbonfootprint has increased from 3.9 to 4.5Gt CO<sub>2</sub>, accounting for about 8% of global
            greenhouse gas emissions.Transport, shopping and food are significant contributors. The majority of this footprint is exerted by and in high-income countries.
            The rapid increase in tourism demand is effectively outstripping the decarbonization of tourism-related technology.</p><br>

            A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, place or product, expressed as carbon 
            dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>). Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of 
            fossil fuels, land clearance and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other 
            services.<br><br>In most cases, the total carbon footprint cannot be calculated exactly because of inadequate knowledge of data about the complex interactions 
            between contributing processes, including the influence of natural processes that store or release carbon dioxide.<br><br><br><br>

            As concern about climate change has grown, individuals are becoming increasingly conscious of their impact on the environment.<br><br>
            Transportation emissions often make up the largest portion of our individual carbon footprints. For that reason, evaluating transport options
            is a natural place to start, whether it is for a daily commute or a leisure trip abroad.<br>
            The carbon footprint of transportation is measured in grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents emitted per person to travel one kilometer.
            This includes both carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.<br><br><br><br>
            Flying on a short flight or driving alone are the most carbon-intensive travel methods. However, adding one more passenger to your car ends up cutting the 
            emissions in half, making driving more efficient.<br><br>
            Specifically, its worth breaking down categories of flights more, as their emissions depend greatly on their route length:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Short Flights</b>:For example, domestic flights within a European country, or flights within a U.S. state have the highest individual carbon footprint.</li><br>
            <li><b>Medium Flights</b>:For example, international travel within Europe, or between U.S. states, have a significantly lower carbon footprint per person.</li><br>
            <li><b>Long Flights</b>:Flights over 3,700 km (2,300 mi), about the distance from Los Angeles to New York, have the lowest carbon footprint per person.</li><br>

            <br><br>In the field of the tourism, hotels and homestay facilities account for considerable amounts of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This study presents an
            investigation conducted on the CO2 emissions from four types of hotel in Taiwan.<br><br>
            According to the results, the average CO2 emissions of international touristhotels, standard tourist hotels, general hotels, and homestay facilities are 28.9, 19.2, 12.5, and 6.3 kg-CO2/person-night, respectively. Hotels with higher 
            service levels produce higher average CO2 emissions per person-night.
