 <center><div class="img"><img src="img/luggage.webp" height="400px" width="600px"></div></center>
 <div class="row4"><p>Heavy luggage can impact the weight of the aircraft and requires more fuel, so be sure to pack light, taking only the essentials that you will need for your trip. If every passenger reduced the weight of their baggage this could help reduce the amount of fuel needed for flights, and also contribute to reducing the amount of waste in the country you are visiting. Instead of buying travel-size toiletries, for example, consider purchasing reusable clear bottles and pots which you can decant your larger bottles into, taking as much as you need for the duration of your trip.
